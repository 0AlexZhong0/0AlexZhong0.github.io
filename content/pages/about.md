Hi, I am Alex Zhong. I study computer science and statistics at the University of Auckland. I envision myself to become a senior software architect in the future. Currently, I am exploring different technologies and fields of software development such as web, system/enterprise applications and OS etc.

I hope by sharing my ups and downs along the journey of discovering and pursuing my passion, you can see what works and what doesnâ€™t, and how you can take my stories as references to accelerate your paths to successes.
